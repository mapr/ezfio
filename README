This test script is intended to give a block-level based overview of
SSD performance (SATA, SAS, and NVME) under real-world conditions by
focusing on sustained performance at different block sizes and queue
depths.  Both text-mode Linux and GUI and text-mode Windows versions
are included.

The results of multiple tests are summarized into a single OpenDoc format
spreadsheet, readable under OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Microsoft Excel.

FIO is required to perform the actual IO tests.  Please ensure the latest
version is installed, either from your operating system's repository or
sources available at https://github.com/axboe/fio or precompiled for
Windows at http://www.bluestop.org/fio/

Tests have been trimmed to a subset of tuning parameters based on MapR
workloads. Please use the help option for more details on how to run the
