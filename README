Quick setup and run steps:
1. Download/Install required tools
    yum install wget unzip
    wget https://github.com/mrasquinha/ezfio/archive/master.zip
    wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

    unzip master.zip
    yum install epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    yum install fio
    yum install sdparm

2. Run test inside a screen or tmux session
    nohup ./ezfio.py -d <device> --yes &
The device needs to be mounted. Usally /dev/xxx
Make sure you do not need any data from the disk.

3. For an estimate on runtime 
    ./ezfio.py -d <device> -e --yes

This test script is intended to give a block-level based overview of
SSD performance (SATA, SAS, and NVME) under real-world conditions by
focusing on sustained performance at different block sizes and queue
depths.  Both text-mode Linux and GUI and text-mode Windows versions
are included.

The results of multiple tests are summarized into a single OpenDoc format
spreadsheet, readable under OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Microsoft Excel.

FIO is required to perform the actual IO tests.  Please ensure the latest
version is installed, either from your operating system's repository or
sources available at https://github.com/axboe/fio or precompiled for
Windows at http://www.bluestop.org/fio/
